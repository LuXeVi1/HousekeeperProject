# House Keeper Robot - Midterm Project CPE 101 (Engineering Exploration)

## Project Overview
The Microbit and HuskyLens Ball Sorting Robot is a robotic system designed to automatically separate two colored balls, red and blue, and place them in designated areas. This project showcases how computer vision and microcontroller technology can be used to automate simple tasks.
This README documents the midterm project for the CPE101 Engineering Exploration course in King Mongkut’s University of Technology Thonburi [(KMUTT)](https://www.kmutt.ac.th/).

## Hardware Requirements
- Microbit
- iBit Robot Kit
- Husky Lens
- 2 Servo motors
- 3D printed ball pick-up tool
- Red and blue colored balls
- Computer

## Software Requirements
- Makecode by Microbit [(Link)](https://makecode.microbit.org)
    - HuskyLens Extensions
    - IBIT Extensions
- Fusion 360 [(Link)](https://asean.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/overview)

## Installation and Setup
1. Connect the servos and HuskyLens to the Microbit.

## Usage
- Upload the provided Microbit code to your Microbit.
- Run the script to control the robot.
- The robot will use HuskyLens to detect red and blue balls, pick them up with the 3D printed tool, and place them in the designated areas.

## Customization
Users can customize the project by adjusting the TagID-based placement areas, altering the 3D printed ball pick-up tool design, or tweaking the robot's behavior by modifying the Microbit code.
